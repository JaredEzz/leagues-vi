# Pact Build Candidates

Concrete 40-pact loadouts being evaluated. Each is a fully-decoded share link from osrsleaguescountdown.io with verified tree connectivity.

## Option 1 — Sustain + F8 Hybrid (40/40)

**Origin:** Forked from "Mage Regenerate Infinite Sustain" (share `1czkAyC8PACA4zAU-gAIRAAA`), with F8 slotted in by dropping leaf prayer-pen overcap.

**Identity:** Self-sustaining Ice Barrage engine with F8 burst for Eye of Ayak. Heavy on healing/regen, moderate DPS. Best for general PvM, Catacombs grinding, Slayer chaining.

### Loadout (40 pacts) — verified connected

C2, C3, CA, CB, CC,
F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F7, F8, F10, F12, F13,

H7, H8, H9, H10,
I1, I2, I5, I6, I7, IB,
J5, J6, J7, J8, J9,
L2, L6
```

**Drops from base share** (3 leaves):
- `BB` — regen +5% leaf. Regen still caps via AA + remaining stacks.
- `K5` — prayer pen leaf. Pen still caps with 7 remaining stacks.
- `K7` — prayer pen leaf. Same.

**Adds** (3 zero-cost adjacent picks):
- `F8` — Powered staff −3 ticks (Eye of Ayak 1-tick, ~2.27× DPS) [neighbors: FB, FC]
- `F10` — Charge regen → +1 fire rune [neighbor: FC]
- `C3` — Fire rune regen → +1 dmg next spell hit per rune [neighbors: B1, CB]

### Key totals (after swaps)

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| Rune/charge regen chance | 100% (capped) |
| Magic damage | +5% (FA, FB, FC, FD, IB) |
| Prayer penetration | 100% (capped, 7 stacks) |
| Accuracy | +80% |
| Defence levels | +25 |
| Overheal cap | +90% HP (3 stacks) |

### Sustain loop

1. Cast Ice Barrage (Kodai) or fire EoA spec → triggers regen rolls
2. AA + 60% regen = ~100% chance to regen runes/charges per cast
3. Regenerated water rune → C2 heals 1 + L2 reflects 60% damage as heal + I2 +20% dmg at full HP
4. Regenerated charges (EoA/Shadow/DHW) → F5 chain regens water rune → C2 chain heals
5. F10 → fire rune regen → C3 buffs next spell damage
6. B1 → magic level boost on every regen tick (caps +10)
7. I6 → passive prayer regen, J8 → 0-dmg hit restores prayer

### Weapon profile

| Weapon | DPS profile |
|---|---|
| Eye of Ayak | F8 1-tick burst, F5/F10 fuel C2/C3 chains via charge regen |
| Tumeken's Shadow | F8 helps (powered staff), but Shadow is 2H so J8 off-hand bonus inactive |
| Kodai Wand (Ice Barrage) | F7 spell speed, L6 makes Ice = water → I2/L2/C2 fire, base AA regen on direct rune use |
| Dragon Hunter Wand | F5/F6/F10 trigger via wand charge regen |

### Caveats

- F8 −8 max hit makes EoA ~2.27× DPS via attack speed, validated in HANDOFF.md math.
- Skips full F+C elemental engine (F6/F9 + C1/C4) to keep healing intact.
- Prayer pen capped at 7 stacks; over-cap was wasted in source build.
- Earth + Air rune regen NOT included → does not exploit earth/air-weak bosses.

## Option 2 — Full Elemental DPS Engine (40/40)

**Origin:** Steiner-tree-optimized DPS build covering all 4 elemental damage chains. Designed to weapon-switch and spell-switch for any boss weakness in your regions. See [boss-weaknesses.md](boss-weaknesses.md) for the cross-referenced target list.

**Identity:** Pure DPS. Zero sustain pacts — relies on prayer flicks, supplies, and Augury for survival. Built for a skilled mage main who can handle mechanics without Pact-driven heals.

### Key totals

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| **Magic damage** | **+8%** (FA, FB, FC, FD, IA, IB, IC, ID — 8 stacks) |
| **Accuracy** | **+80%** (F1 +35% + CA/CB/CC 3×15%) |
| Rune/charge regen chance | 95% (50% AA + 3×5% BA/BB/BC + 30% F3) |
| Spell speed (spellbook) | F7 (−2 ticks, Ice/Smoke/Blood/Shadow Barrage to 3 ticks) |
| Powered staff speed | **F8 (−3 ticks, Eye of Ayak to 1-tick)** |
| Prayer penetration | +30% (I5 + I7) — partial, dropped to fit DPS |
| Defence levels | 0 — dropped entirely |
| Overheal cap | 0 — dropped entirely |

### The four elemental chains

| Element | Damage payload | Conversion | Charge→rune | Rune→payload |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Air** | I1 (+7% per active prayer) | L5 (Smoke→Air) | F6 | C1 (15% chance restore prayer) |
| **Water** | I2 (+20% at full HP) | L6 (Ice→Water) | F5 | (no C2 — heal dropped) |
| **Fire** | I3 (burn 6% HP for 2× return), L3 (burn + bounce) | L7 (Blood→Fire) | F10 | C3 (+1 dmg next spell hit) |
| **Earth** | I4 (drain enemy def + mage def 2/hit), L4 (+1 dmg per 12 def) | L8 (Shadow→Earth) | F9 | C4 (+1 def level per rune) |

Plus **L1**: Air spells +1% max-hit chance per prayer bonus, **doubled vs air-weak enemies** (only weakness-exploit pact in tree).

### Spellbook → boss matrix

**Critical clarification:** Powered staves (Eye of Ayak, Tumeken's Shadow) cast a **classless magic projectile** — NOT a typed spell. None of L1/L2/L3/L4/L5/L6/L7/L8 apply to their built-in attacks. Only `F8` (powered staff speed) helps them. The L-payloads only fire when you cast a **spellbook spell** with a wand.

| Boss element | Cast spell | Spellbook | Damage payloads triggered |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Earth-weak** (Olm, Wardens, Hueycoatl, Hydra, Kraken, Dark beast) | **Earth Surge** (single) OR **Shadow Barrage + L8** (multi) | Standard / Ancient | I4 (drain def 2/hit), L4 (+1 dmg per 12 def), C4 chain, F9 chain |
| **Water-weak** (Inferno, Yama, Hellhounds, DGorillas, Skotizo) | **Water Surge** (single) OR **Ice Barrage + L6** (multi) | Standard / Ancient | I2 (+20% @ full HP), F5 chain |
| **Fire-weak** (Ice Demon 150%, Vespula, Kephri, KQ, Amoxliatl) | **Fire Surge** (single) OR **Blood Barrage + L7** (multi) | Standard / Ancient | I3 (burn boost), L3 (burn+bounce AoE), C3 chain, F10 chain |
| **Air-weak** (Thermo, Smoke devils, Ankou) | **Air Surge** (single) OR **Smoke Barrage + L5** (multi) | Standard / Ancient | I1 (+7% per prayer), L1 (max hit chance, **2× vs air-weak**), F6/C1 chain |
| **No weakness** (Sol, Doom, Echos, ToA Akkha/Ba-Ba/Zebak, CoX side bosses) | Eye of Ayak built-in OR Shadow built-in | Powered staff | F8 1-tick burst + +8% raw mage damage. **No L payloads.** |

**Why keep the L conversions in Option 2:** they let you stay on Ancient Magicks (Barrage spellbook) for AoE Slayer/Catacombs grinding while still triggering elemental payloads. For single bosses, native Surge spells already work — see Option 3 if you don't need barrage AoE.

### Weapon profile

| Weapon | Best use | Pact synergies |
|---|---|---|
| **Eye of Ayak** (powered staff, 1H) | No-weakness single bosses, Doom delves, general PvM | F8 1-tick, +8% raw mage damage. **No L payloads** (built-in spell isn't a typed element). |
| **Tumeken's Shadow** (powered staff, 2H) | No-weakness bosses where raw DPS matters (Sol, Doom, Echos) | F8 1-tick, +8% mage damage stack ×3 (Shadow's passive triples gear bonus). **No L payloads.** |
| **Kodai Wand** (1H) + Ancient Magicks | All weakness exploitation via Barrage AoE | F7 spell speed, all 4 L conversions, all 4 I/L payloads |
| **Dragon Hunter Wand** (1H) | Dragons (Brimhaven, Hydra) — Hydra is earth-weak → cast Earth Surge or Shadow Barrage + L8 | F8 does NOT apply (wand). Use DHW's +75% acc/+40% dmg vs dragons + earth payloads |

### Off-hand swaps

| Off-hand | When |
|---|---|
| **Devil's Element** (Echo Thermy, Kandarin) | Default endgame — **doubles enemy elemental weaknesses** (Hueycoatl 60% → 120%, Ice Demon 150% → 300%). The single biggest force multiplier on this build. |
| **Tome of Water** (Tempoross, Desert) | Water-weak bosses pre-Devil's Element. +10% dmg on water spells |
| **Elidinis' Ward** (ToA, Desert) | Defensive interim. No element synergy |

### What's intentionally dropped vs Option 1

- **C2** (water rune → +1 heal)
- **L2** (water spell hits → 60% dmg heal)
- **F2, F13, H9** (3× overheal cap, +90% HP)
- **I6** (passive prayer regen)
- **J8** (0-dmg hit → +2 hp +2 prayer)
- **F4, F12, H8** (defence levels +25)
- **7 prayer pen stacks** (kept only 2 — 30% vs 100% capped)

In exchange you gain:
- **+3% magic damage** (5 → 8 stacks)
- **All 4 elemental damage chains** (was water-only)
- **All 4 spell conversions** (L5/L7/L8 added)
- **F8** Eye of Ayak burst
- **F1** +35% accuracy

### Caveats

- **Powered staves are not boosted by L payloads** — confirmed via wiki. Eye of Ayak and Tumeken's Shadow built-in spells are classless. Use them on no-weakness bosses where raw +mage damage and F8 speed matter most.
- **No prayer regen** — must drink restores or use altars between fights.
- **No heal sustain** — must brew/sara brews/blood barrage manually.
- **Ice Demon at 150% fire weakness × Devil's Element 2× = effective 300%** — Blood Barrage + L7 melts Ice Demon for fast CoX.
- **Hueycoatl at 60% earth × Devil's Element = 120%** — Shadow Barrage + L8 (or Earth Surge native) on this Day 1 DHW farming target.
- **L conversions pay off ONLY for AoE Slayer/multi-target.** For single bosses, switch to Standard spellbook and cast native Surge spells.

### Slot-swap candidates if you want a sustain hybrid

Drop these DPS picks to free slots for sustain:

| Drop | Effect lost | Gain back |
|---|---|---|
| `L5` (smoke→air) | Smoke Barrage no longer counts as air | Slot for `C2` (water heal) — direct add |
| `I7` (+15% prayer pen) | Prayer pen 30% → 15% | Slot for `F2` (overheal +30%) — direct add |
| `I5` (+15% prayer pen) | Prayer pen 15% → 0% | Slot for `J8` (0-dmg sustain) — needs path |

---

## Option 3 — Middle Ground: DPS + Light Sustain (40/40)

**Identity:** Drops the Slayer-only Barrage conversions (L5/L7/L8) and air-weakness exploit (L1) to fit critical sustain. Keeps the full single-boss DPS engine: all 8 mage damage stacks, all 4 elemental I-payloads, the L3/L4 large damage payloads, full F+C rune-regen chains, F8/F7. Adds back C2 heal, L2 bounce heal, 2× overheal cap, +20 def levels.

**Best for:** Hard PvM mains who don't barrage-grind Slayer often. Single bosses use native Surge spells which already trigger I/L payloads without conversions. Survival cushion for Inferno/ToA/Sol learning.

```

**Note:** v2 swaps `I5` (15% prayer pen, mostly wasted at 1 stack) for `CA` (+15% accuracy + critical bridge that lets F1 unlock at task 5 instead of task 21). Net: better accuracy AND better unlock order.

### Key totals

| Stat | Value | vs Option 2 |
|---|---|---|
| **Magic damage** | **+8%** | same |
| Accuracy | **+80%** | same as Option 2 |
| Regen chance | 95% | same |
| Spell speed | F7 + F8 | same |
| Prayer pen | 0% | dropped |
| **Defence levels** | **+20** | +20 |
| **Overheal cap** | **+60% HP** | +60% |
| **Heal payloads** | **C2 + L2** | both added back |

### What's kept from Option 2

- **All 8 mage damage stacks** (FA, FB, FC, FD, IA, IB, IC, ID)
- **All 4 elemental damage payloads** (I1 air, I2 water, I3 fire, I4 earth)
- **L3 + L4** (fire bounce/burn + earth flat damage — large pacts, the high-impact payloads)
- **L6** (Ice Barrage → water for Slayer Catacombs water-weak content)
- **All 4 charge→rune** (F5/F6/F9/F10) and **all 4 rune→payload** (C1/C2/C3/C4)
- **F1, F7, F8** (accuracy, spell speed, powered staff burst)

### What's dropped from Option 2

- `L1` air weakness exploit — air is your lowest-priority element
- `L5` smoke→air conversion — only useful for AoE Slayer on smoke devils
- `L7` blood→fire conversion — Fire Surge already triggers I3/L3 natively
- `L8` shadow→earth conversion — Earth Surge already triggers I4/L4 natively
- `I5` + `I7` (both prayer pen stacks)

### What's added back for sustain

- `C2` — water rune regen → heal 1 per rune
- `L2` — water spell hits bounce 60% damage as heal
- `F2` — overheal cap +30% HP
- `H9` — overheal cap +30% HP (2× total = +60%)
- `F4` — +15 Defence levels
- `H8` — +5 Defence levels (also bridge connector)

### Boss matrix (no conversions, just native spells)

| Boss element | Cast | Spellbook | Triggers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Earth** (Olm, Wardens, Hueycoatl, Hydra, Kraken) | **Earth Surge** | Standard | I4 (drain def 2/hit), L4 (+1 dmg/12 def), C4, F9 chain |
| **Water** (Inferno, Yama, Hellhounds, DGorillas) | **Water Surge** OR **Ice Barrage + L6** | Standard / Ancient | I2 (+20% @ full HP), L2 (60% bounce heal), C2 heal, F5 chain |
| **Fire** (Ice Demon, Vespula, Kephri, KQ) | **Fire Surge** | Standard | I3 (burn boost), L3 (burn+bounce AoE), C3, F10 chain |
| **Air** (Thermo, Smoke devils, Ankou) | **Air Surge** | Standard | I1 (+7% per active prayer), F6/C1 chain |
| **No weakness** | Eye of Ayak / Shadow built-in | Powered staff | F8 1-tick burst + +8% raw mage dmg |

### Tradeoff vs Option 2

| | Option 2 (Pure DPS) | Option 3 (Hybrid) |
|---|---|---|
| AoE Slayer barrage damage | Excellent (all conversions) | Limited (only L6 Ice Barrage→water) |
| Single-boss DPS | Excellent | Excellent (same stacks, payloads) |
| Sustain | None | Moderate (heal + overheal + def) |
| Survival in Inferno/Sol | Pure mechanics | Pacts contribute |
| Best for | Pure DPS, weapon-switch heavy | Mixed PvM, learning hard content |

### Why this is the recommended endgame build

- **Native Surge spells** already trigger I1-I4 and L3/L4 payloads without needing L5/L7/L8 conversions. The ~3 pact slots saved are better spent on sustain.
- **L6 (Ice→water) is kept** because Ice Barrage is the multi-target spell of choice for Slayer/Catacombs grinding on water-weak content (Hellhounds 50%, Demonic Gorillas 35%, Skotizo 40%) — there's no "water barrage" so this conversion is the only way to AoE on water.
- **Sustain matters** for hard PvM learning. Brews/restores work but pacts that auto-heal or restore prayer give breathing room when learning Sol/Inferno/Echo bosses.
- **F8 + 8 mage damage stacks** carries no-weakness content (Sol Heredit, Doom of Mokhaiotl, Echo content, ToA non-Wardens, CoX side bosses) just as well as Option 2.

## Option 4 — Virtus DPS Variant (40/40, Reset #2 target post-Virtus drop)

**Identity:** Option 3 with the L5/L7/L8 spell-type conversions added back. Designed to be activated via **Reset #2** once Virtus pieces drop from Leviathan in Phase 3-4. Pivots from "Surge + Ancestral" single-target casting to **"Barrage + L conversion + Virtus"** for every elemental weakness.

**When to switch from Option 3 to Option 4:** as soon as you have full Virtus (mask + top + bottom) in hand. Until then, stay on Option 3.

### What changed from Option 3

| Action | Pact | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Drop** | `L2` (water bounce heal large) | Heal sustain — Virtus + Devil's Element makes you kill so fast the heal matters less |
| **Drop** | `F2` (overheal cap +30%) | Sustain — keeping H9 for 1 stack is enough |
| **Drop** | `BB` (+5% regen leaf) | Regen still capped at 90%+ via AA + BA + BC + F3 |
| **Add** | **`L5`** (Smoke spells → air) | Smoke Barrage now triggers I1/L1 air payloads. AoE air-weak targets |
| **Add** | **`L7`** (Blood spells → fire) | Blood Barrage now triggers I3/L3 fire payloads. AoE fire-weak targets |
| **Add** | **`L8`** (Shadow spells → earth) | Shadow Barrage now triggers I4/L4 earth payloads. AoE earth-weak targets |

### Damage math: why this is worth it

**Setup comparison** with full endgame mage stack (Pact stacks +8%, Confliction +7%, Devil's Element +6%, Occult +5%, Avernic Treads +1% = +27% accessories), targeting weakness-tagged content with Devil's Element doubling weakness:

| Target | Setup A: Surge + Ancestral | Setup B: Barrage + L conversion + Virtus | Δ per cast |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fire-weak** (Vespula 50%, doubled to 100%) | Fire Surge max ~65 | Blood Barrage + L7 max ~82 | **+26%** |
| **Earth-weak** (Olm 50%, doubled to 100%) | Earth Surge max ~71 | Shadow Barrage + L8 max ~80 | **+12%** |
| **Air-weak** (Thermo 20%, doubled to 40%) | Air Surge max ~42 | Smoke Barrage + L5 max ~54 | **+28%** |
| **Water-weak** (Yama 50%, doubled to 100%) | Water Surge max ~65 | Ice Barrage + L6 max ~85 | **+30%** |

**Two damage levers compound:**
1. **Barrages have higher base max hit** (Smoke 27, Shadow 28, Blood 29, Ice 30) than Surges (Air 22, Fire 24, Water 24, Earth 26)
2. **Virtus on Ancients = +15%** mage damage vs Ancestral's +9% on Standard — a +6% damage modifier swing

The smallest gain is on Earth (only +12%) because Earth Surge already has the highest Surge max hit. The biggest gains are on Air and Water where Surges are weakest base.

Plus AoE multi-target (3×3) on every Barrage cast, which Surges don't get at all.

### Headline totals

| Stat | Value | vs Option 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Magic damage | +8% | same |
| Accuracy | +80% | same |
| Regen chance | 90% (still effectively capped) | −5% (dropped BB) |
| Spell speed | F7 + F8 | same |
| Prayer pen | 0% | same |
| Defence levels | +20 | same |
| Overheal cap | +30% HP (1 stack) | −30% (dropped F2) |
| Heal payloads | C2 only | dropped L2 |
| **Spell conversions** | **L5 + L6 + L7 + L8 (all 4)** | **+L5/L7/L8** |
| **Effective DPS on weakness content** | **+12-30% per cast** | **major upgrade** |

### Boss matrix (Option 4 endgame)

| Boss element | Best spell | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Earth** (Olm, Wardens, Hueycoatl, Hydra, Kraken, Dark beast) | **Shadow Barrage + L8** | Virtus +15% + I4 (drain mage def) + L4 (+1 dmg/12 def) + AoE on trash |
| **Water** (Yama, Inferno, Hellhounds, DGorillas, Skotizo) | **Ice Barrage + L6** | Virtus +15% + I2 (+20% @ full HP) + AoE freeze |
| **Fire** (Ice Demon, Vespula, Kephri, KQ, Amoxliatl) | **Blood Barrage + L7** | Virtus +15% + I3 (burn boost) + L3 (burn + bounce) + heal 25% + AoE |
| **Air** (Thermo, Smoke devils, Ankou) | **Smoke Barrage + L5** | Virtus +15% + I1 (+7% per active prayer) + Smoke poison + AoE |
| **No weakness** (Sol, Doom, Echos, ToA Akkha/Ba-Ba/Zebak) | **Eye of Ayak built-in** | Powered staff F8 1-tick + Ancestral robes (powered staves don't get Virtus's Ancients bonus) |

### Robe swap reminder

Even with Option 4 unlocked, you still **swap robes** based on weapon:
- **Eye of Ayak / Tumeken's Shadow** (powered staves) → **Ancestral** (Virtus bonus doesn't apply to non-spellbook spells)
- **Kodai Wand + any Barrage** → **Virtus** (where the +15% pays off)

Option 4 is built around the Kodai+Virtus loadout. Eye of Ayak still uses Ancestral.

### Caveats

- **Conditional on Virtus.** If Virtus doesn't drop, this build is worse than Option 3 (Virtus +6% advantage on Ancients flips to a +3% disadvantage if forced to use Virtus on Standard, OR you stay on Ancestral and the Ancients spell type conversions still trigger I/L payloads at +9% which is fine but not as good as +15% with Virtus).
- **Less sustain than Option 3.** Lose L2 heal + F2 overheal stack. You're trading sustain for ~25% damage on every cast. With higher damage, fights end faster — sustain matters less, but punishment for mistakes matters more.
- **Reset #2 cost.** This consumes one of your 3 league resets. Plan it carefully — switch when full Virtus is in hand, not before.
- **Phase 3-4 is the right window.** Phase 5 endgame Inferno may want Reset #3 anyway for content-specific tuning, so don't burn both resets early.

### Decision tree

```
Have full Virtus set?
├── Yes → Switch to Option 4 via Reset #2
└── No  → Stay on Option 3
            └── Got Virtus pieces in late Phase 4?
                ├── Yes → Reset #2 → Option 4
                └── No  → Stay Option 3, save Reset #2 for Inferno tuning
```
